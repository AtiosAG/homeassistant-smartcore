# Atios SmartCore Home Assistant integration

![Atios SmartCore: Matter on one side, DALI-2 bus, 12 inputs and 12 relay outputs on the other](images/smartcore-matter-dali-io.png)

The [Atios SmartCore](https://atios.ch/products/smartcore) is a Matter-certified
controller with 12 built-in IOs and a DALI-2 Master. It's powered by 24V DC or
via PoE, and also powers the DALI bus.

## Standard setup: Matter (no integration needed)

Because the SmartCore is a certified Matter device, it pairs directly with Home
Assistant. Most users need only this:

1. Visit [setup.atios.ch](https://setup.atios.ch/) to find your SmartCore on
   your local network, and connect to its local web interface
   ([see online demo here](https://r12.atios.ch/app/)).
2. Create devices in the **Accessory Manager**, e.g. a light bulb from one
   input and one output.
3. DALI devices: scan the bus in the **DALI Configurator** tab.
4. Back in the Accessory Manager, use DALI single addresses or groups as
   outputs, and DALI-2 sensors as inputs for any device type.
5. Pair the SmartCore with Home Assistant via **Matter**. Every light, blind
   and sensor from the Accessory Manager shows up as its own entity.

## What this repo is for: expert use

This integration gives you **raw DALI access** from Home Assistant: send and
receive arbitrary DALI commands, for example to process live DALI-2 events
from sensors that the SmartCore and its Matter integration do not support yet.

It also provides DALI scene recall, a bus monitor, per-address lights, a
firmware update entity, and the SmartCore web UI as a sidebar panel. Fully
local (push over LAN), no cloud, no external Python dependencies. Works
standalone or alongside a Matter-paired SmartCore.

## Installation

**Step 1: Install HACS** (one-time; skip if you already have it in your sidebar)

1. Go to **Settings → Apps → App store**, open the **⋮** menu (top right) →
   **Repositories**, and add `https://github.com/hacs/addons`. Then install
   the **Get HACS** app and press **Start**.
2. Restart Home Assistant (**Settings → System → Restart**).
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & services**, click **Add integration**
   (bottom right), search for **HACS**, and follow the GitHub sign-in
   (a free GitHub account is required; you'll enter a short code at
   github.com/login/device).

**Step 2: Install the Atios SmartCore integration**

4. Search for **Atios SmartCore** in HACS, click **Download**, and restart
   Home Assistant once more.

5. Go to **Settings → Devices & services**, click **Add integration**
   (bottom right), select **Atios SmartCore**, and enter your SmartCore's
   IP address. Done.

We plan to submit this integration to Home Assistant core in a bit.

## Status

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| DALI frame encode/decode (`dali.py`) | ✅ verified against reference frames (`FF 10` goto-scene, `01 91` query-gear-present) |
| Transport (`hub.py`) | ✅ native aiohttp; HTTP `/api/dali/iface` confirmed on device, `ws://<host>/ws` monitor connects (101) |
| Broadcast light + brightness/on/off | ✅ |
| NVRAM device model (`nvram.py`) | ✅ reads `/api/dali/nvm` (control + input devices, paginated); parser verified against captured fixtures |
| Named lights from NVRAM | ✅ every configured short address and group becomes a named light; legacy options list as fallback |
| QUERY status read | ✅ HTTP answer shape confirmed on device (`{success,bus_busy,collision_detected,data}`) |
| `send_dali_frame` / `recall_scene` services | ✅ |
| DALI-2 event decode (`dali.py`) | ✅ 62386-103/-301, verified byte-for-byte vs python-dali on 585 frames |
| Button events (`event.py`) | ✅ pre-created from the NVRAM model with configured names; unknown buttons still auto-appear on first press |
| Occupancy sensors (62386-303) | 🟨 entities from NVRAM, state from bus events; bit mapping still to be verified on hardware |
| Light sensors (62386-304) | 🟨 entities from NVRAM, raw 10-bit level; lux conversion pending hardware verification |
| Zeroconf discovery | 🟨 flow built; confirm the SmartCore's actual mDNS/TXT on device and tighten the manifest |
| Firmware `update` entity | ✅ installed version from `/ota_status`; latest-version source still needed for update *notifications* |
| Web-UI iframe panel | ✅ sidebar panel via options flow; probes for X-Frame-Options / CSP / mixed-content and warns |

Confirmed on SmartCore firmware 2.7.5.
